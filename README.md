URL Express
=================================

# Introduction

**URL Express** is a JavaFX application which uses [**MagicURLNetwork**](https://github.com/magiclen/MagicURLNetwork "MagicURLNetwork") to make URL connections. You can easily create a request (which means you can set the method, headers, parameters for that request) for a URL resource. The requests you created are able to be saved to files and you can load them back anytime. This is very useful for testing RESTful APIs(or http/https APIs).

# Usage

##### 1. Run the program file named **URLExpress.jar**. #####
##### 2. Choose a request method(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD). #####
##### 3. Input a URL. #####
##### 4. Set authentication if you need. #####
##### 5. Set user agent if you need. #####
##### 6. Set headers if you need. #####
##### 7. Set parameters. #####
##### 8. If the data that server responsed is not a text, you can save it into a file directly by inputing a file path. #####
##### 9. Click the 'Send' button to send your request. #####
##### 10. After seconds, you can get a response from the server. #####
##### 11. If you want to save your request, click 'File' -> 'Save'. #####
##### 12. If you want to load your request, click 'File' -> 'Open'. #####
